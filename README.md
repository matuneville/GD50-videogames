# GD50: 2D Videogames 🕹️👾🎮

My work on the first part of [**CS50's Introduction to Game Development**](https://www.edx.org/learn/game-development/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-game-development) course, offered by Harvard University. This section is about 2D videogames.  

It contains the recreated videogames of each lecture with a personal style, and the assignments of each one. Videogames are developed in **Lua**, with [LÖVE 2D](https://github.com/love2d/love) framework.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> To **run a game**, execute `love myGame` with LÖVE installed
